# MouseHunt Horn Timer
A chrome extension that alerts the user to sound the horn when the horn is ready. (Works on OperaGX as well, have not tested on other web browsers and I do not have any intentions of extending this to other web browsers.)
**DISCLAIMER**: I have sent a message to HitGrab to check if the behaviour of this extension violates any of their T&Cs but they have yet to respond at this current time, use this at your own risk! This is not a bot and there are no automations for sounding the horn!

## Usage
Once the extension has been added, visit your mousehunt site, and the extension should start working on its own! 
Pin the extension to watch the countdown timer appear on the pinned extension!
When the horn is ready, a notification will pop out! (As long as you have allowed your browser's notification)
Click on the notification to be redirected to the mousehunt site! 
The redirecting works even when the mousehunt tab has been closed. 
Ignore the notification if you do not wish to be redirected to Mousehunt.
